## Issue we face in ticketing today

The current ticketing market is fundamentally flawed, with numerous instances of fans being duped, artists fighting fraud, and exorbitant ticket prices due to scalpers and bots. The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the black-box fee and ownership model employed by centralized ticketing companies, which obscures the fair value of tickets, their legitimacy, and allows for huge, unmerited profits. This non-transparent system serves those profiting from the status quo, which includes event organizers who choose outdated ticketing technologies that enable a vibrant secondary market to exist, and facilitate non-transparent business models. It's imperative to remove this "black box" nature and establish an open and transparent record of value flows in the ticketing market. Blockchain offers a promising solution to these issues, fostering transparency and accountability in ticket sales, and enabling consumers to make informed decisions.

## What is TIXO

TIXO is a revolutionary Web3 decentralized ticketing platform, purpose-built to redefine connections between artists, venues, promoters, and fans at live events. Our groundbreaking platform harnesses the power of blockchain technology to increase the profitability of events for organizers and artists through audience ownership, loyalty, and ticket resale.
