# Tixo Protocol: On-chain Event Ticket Minting and Management

The provided solidity contracts `Event` and `TixoProtocolV1` are designed for the creation and management of events and associated tickets.

## Contract Details

### Event Contract

This contract is based on `ERC1155Mintable` from Infura, and uses `Counters` for managing unique IDs for tickets. The main operations in this contract are:

#### Ticket Minting
- Tickets are minted by paying a specific price (`_ticketPrice`), and the number of tickets is limited (`_maxTickets`).
- Each minted ticket has a unique identifier, generated by the `_ticketIds` counter.
- When a ticket is minted, the value is transferred to the owner of the contract and a `TicketMinted` event is emitted.

### TixoProtocolV1 Contract

This contract manages the collection of events. It uses `Counters` for generating unique IDs for events. The primary features of this contract are:

#### Event Creation
- New events are created and registered through the `registerEvent` function. The event is associated with a ticket price, a maximum number of tickets, and a URI.
- A unique identifier is generated for each event by the `_eventIds` counter.
- The ownership of the newly created event contract is transferred to the creator (caller) of the event.
- After the creation of an event, an `EventCreated` event is emitted.

#### Accessible Information
- The contract allows querying for event information (address) using its unique identifier through the `getEvent` function.
- The `getLastEventId` function can be used to fetch the latest event's unique identifier.

## How To Use

To deploy these smart contracts, you'll need to use an EVM-compatible network (like Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, etc.) and a deployment tool such as Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix. 

After deployment, events can be created, tickets can be minted by paying the specified ticket price, and information about events and tickets can be queried.

These smart contracts are intended to be deployed and used with the [Infura SDK](https://docs.infura.io/infura-expansion-apis/nft-api/nft-sdk/how-to/deploy-a-contract).

## Concluding Note

These smart contracts provide a transparent and secure means for creating events and minting associated tickets, making them suitable for any application intending to include these functionalities.

Please refer to the source code comments for a more detailed understanding of the workings of these smart contracts.
