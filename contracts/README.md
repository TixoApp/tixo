# Tixo Collection Smart Contract V1
Tixo Protocol is used to manage the creation of events, minting of tickets and the subsequent ownership of those tickets.

## Contract Details
The contract is named `TixoCollectionV1` and extends `ERC721URIStorage` and `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin. It uses `Counters` for managing unique IDs for events and tickets.

### Key Features

#### Event Creation
- Events can be created by any user.
- Each event has a unique identifier, a ticket price, a maximum ticket limit, and an owner (the creator of the event).
- When an event is created, it emits an `EventCreated` event.

#### Ticket Minting
- Tickets can be minted (created) by any user by paying the event's ticket price.
- Each ticket has a unique identifier, which is derived from the event ID and the ticket ID within that event.
- When a ticket is minted, it emits a `TicketMinted` event and the value is transferred to the event's owner.
- Tickets are represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ensuring verifiable ownership and uniqueness.

#### Collection URI Management
- The contract owner (deployer) can update the base URI for the collection.
- Whenever the URI is updated, a `CollectionURIUpdated` event is emitted.

### Accessible Information
- Any user can query the latest event ID, last ticket ID for a specific event, ticket price for a specific event, and the owner of a specific event.

## How To Use
To use this smart contract, you'll need to deploy it on an EVM network (like the mainnet, Polygon, etc.) using a deployment tool like Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix.

This includes creating events, minting tickets by paying the specified ticket price, and querying information about events and tickets.

## Concluding Note
This smart contract allows for the secure and transparent creation and management of events and their associated tickets, making it an excellent choice for any application looking to include these features.
